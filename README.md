# surakshaapp

A new Flutter project.
This app is used to connect homeless children and orphanages 

## Getting Started

Normally we find homeless children around places we visit. This app gives an opportunity to broadcast 
nearby orphanages registered in this app about the basic info of the child and his current location.

Currently app is built in its initial stage. Soon more features will be included
